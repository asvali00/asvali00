- 👋 Hi, I’m @asvali00... 25 years old ex-junior mech. eng. researcher at FESB .... who is looking to learn new things and chase data science career...
- 👀 I’m interested in Scientific Computing - specially numerical analsys and machine learning, also I'm quite keen on open source...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning concepts of deep learning that would hopefully help me improve my old projects in mechanical engineering (PIV)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, data visualisation and any area that involves numerical analysis... 
     but let me be honest... I'm nerd... so any new tech and engineering project I would be thrilled.
